# Used-Car- Price Modeling Summary for Dealership Clients
Answering the challenge of what drives used car sales
Business Problem
- Accurately price incoming inventory
- Optimize purchasing and marketing strategies - Identify valuable vehicles faster
Our goal was to create a predictive model that identifies the key drivers of used car price using real-world vehicle listing data.

Key Findings
- Stock newer vehicles with low mileage and in good condition
- Prioritize automatic, AWD/4WD, and electric/hybrid cars
- Target in-demand brands like Toyota, Honda, and Ford
- Implement a pricing assistant tool using this model

Next Steps
1. Inventory Acquisition:
- Prioritize vehicles 5 years old or newer
- Target mileage below 80,000 miles
- Choose vehicles in excellent or good condition with clean titles
2. Model Mix:
- SUVs and trucks with AWD or 4WD tend to sell quickly - Hybrids and electric cars are gaining value and appeal - Sedans with good fuel economy still perform well in budget-conscious markets
3. Presentation & Pricing:
- Highlight features like low mileage, one owner, and fuel efficiency
- Use this model's predictions to validate and set competitive prices
- Leverage popular paint colors (white, black, silver) for broader appeal
